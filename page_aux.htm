<h4>Auxiliary apps</h4>

When working with TopoDroid, you might find useful some complementary and auxiliary apps:
<ul>
<li><i>Proj4</i> is a (very simple) coordinate converter app, used by TopoDroid to convert long-lat values to other coordinate systems</li>
<li><i>MobileTopographer</i> is a geolocation app. You can use it to take the point coordinates and have TopoDroid read them from the point file in MobileTopographer pointlist.</li>
<li><i>GPX Recorder</i> and <i>GPS Position</i> can save tracks of geopoints to gpx and csv files, respectively. TopoDroid can read these files and use the last geopoint to set the coordinates of a fixed point.</li>
<li><i>GPSTest</i> can put the coordinates in the clipboard, from which they can be pasted into the TopoDroid geo-point insert dialog.
Geo-points can also be imported from a <i>GPSTest</i> log file.</li>
<li><i>CrowdMag</i> is an app by NOAA National Geophysical Data Center, useful to get information about the current state of the Earth magnetic field.</li>
<li>an app to take pictures (usually there is a <i>Camera</i> app)</li>
<li>a decent File Manager, such as <i>MiXplorer</i>, to look at the files and to make backup copies</li>
<li><i>SQLiteViewer</i> (or any other SQLite manager app) can be helpful to inspect the TopoDroid databases</li>
</ul><br><p>

In addition, depending how you process your surveys, you may want to install
<ul>
<li>a image viewer/editor (usually there is a preinstalled app)</li>
<li>a DXF viewer/editor</li>
<li>a spreadsheet viewer/editor</li>
<li>a SVG viewer</li>
<li>a ZIP archiver</li>
<li><i>GoogleEarth</i></li>
<!-- li><i>AndroWish</i> if you really want to use <i>xtherion</i> on Android (but it will not execute Therion) </li -->
<li>a track file viewer</li>
</ul><br><p>


<b>Proj4</b><br>
TopoDroid stores point coordinates in the reference system geographical long-lat WGS-84.
Altitudes are stored both referred to the ellipsoid and to the geoid.<br><p>

The app Proj4 is used by TopoDroid in two ways to transform coordinates between WGS-84 and other coordinate systems.
<ul>
<li>to <a href="page_fixed.htm">convert</a> the coordinates of a point from long-lat (WGS-84) to another coordinate reference system.</li> 
<li>to <a href="page_fixed_add.htm">enter</a> the coordinates of a point in a different coordinate system.</li>
</ul><br><p>
