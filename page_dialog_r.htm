<h4>Android R dialog</h4>

Starting with Android-11, TopoDroidX cannot access files in the usual way, as of a Google requirement.<br>

The app private files (device database, drawing symbols, firmware files, etc.) are stored
in the app private space, "Android/data/com.TopoDroidX.TDX/files", where other apps do not have
access.<br>
This folder is deleted by the system when you uninstall the app.
<br> 

The survey database and files are stored under "Documents/TDX/TopoDroidX".<br>
This folder is not deleted by the system when you uninstall the app,
but <b>TopoDroidX cannot access it any more if you uninstall and reinstall the app.</b><br>
In that case you have to rename "Documents/TDX" and cold-start TopoDroidX so that it creates
its new "TDX".<br>
